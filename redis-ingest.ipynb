      "Detail:   The Andromeda galaxy, also known as M31, is a spiral galaxy located approximately 2.5 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Andromeda. It is the closest major galaxy to our own Milky Way galaxy and is a member of the Local Group of galaxies, which also includes the Milky Way, the Triangulum galaxy (M33), and several smaller galaxies and dwarf galaxies.  The Andromeda galaxy has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and is estimated to contain about 2 trillion stars, making it one of the largest galaxies in the observable universe. It is also home to a variety of other celestial objects, including black holes, supernovae, and planetary nebulae.  The Andromeda galaxy is classified as a barred spiral galaxy, meaning it has a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars and gas. It also has several spiral arms that wind outward from the center, containing many stars, gas, and dust. The galaxy is believed to be rotating rapidly, with stars and gas moving at speeds of up to 300 kilometers per second.  The Andromeda galaxy is also home to a variety of star clusters, which are groups of stars that formed together over time. Some of these clusters are very young, with ages of only a few million years, while others are much older, with ages of billions of years.  In addition to its scientific importance, the Andromeda galaxy is also a popular target for astronomers and Astro photographers due to its brightness and distinctive appearance. It is often visible to the naked eye on clear nights and can be easily observed with a telescope.   \n",

      "Detail:   The Milky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos), meaning \"milky circle\".[26][27] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[28] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis,[29] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.   \n",

The Andromeda galaxy has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and is estimated to contain about 2 trillion stars, making it one of the largest galaxies in the observable universe. It is also home to a variety of other celestial objects, including black holes, supernovae, and planetary nebulae.  The Andromeda galaxy is classified as a barred spiral galaxy, meaning it has a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars and gas. It also has several spiral arms that wind outward from the center, containing many stars, gas, and dust. The galaxy is believed to be rotating rapidly, with stars and gas moving at speeds of up to 300 kilometers per second.  The Andromeda galaxy is also home to a variety of star clusters, which are groups of stars that formed together over time. Some of these clusters are very young, with ages of only a few million years, while others are much older, with ages of billions of years.  In addition to its scientific importance, the Andromeda galaxy is also a popular target for astronomers and Astro photographers due to its brightness and distinctive appearance. It is often visible to the naked eye on clear nights and can be easily observed with a telescope.   ',\n",

       "  'detail': '  The Milky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy\\'s appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos), meaning \"milky circle\".[26][27] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[28] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis,[29] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.
